# Rachel, $git itdone

to install meteor onto a mac through the command line:
```$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh```

to create a new meteor app, cd in to the directory you want your meteor app to be in, and in your command line, type:
```$ meteor create myapp```

cd in your new meteor app.
start up the server by:  ```$ meteor```

to connect to the mongo DB: ```$ meteor mongo```

VOILA!  Meteor, by default, has starter code for a simple counter application. So at this point, unless you want a simple counter application, you need to replace the starter code with your own.



To create Rachel, $git itdone, I followed a tutorial from https://www.meteor.com to create a sweet to do list app.  I also referred to the documentation from meteor.com, as well as this article, http://javascriptissexy.com/learn-meteor-js-properly/ , which I found helpful.


Meteor is an open source javaScript framework makes creating applications more efficient and helps bridges the gap between the server and browser. It reminded me of a mix between rails and angular, although those are two very different things.  But the set up felt easy (because it was), which reminded me how rails generates all the folders and some code you need to get started.  

Meteor was developed and maintained by Meteor Development Group.
